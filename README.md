# What even is this game?

This is a game I had to make for a project in high school.
I only had two weeks to make it! Hope you like it lol.

## Inspiration

At first Retro Rhythm started out as a dead, unfinished project sitting in my desktop,
gathering dust and never getting done; that is, until one day I was watching
YouTube and came across a video about someone who made a rhythm game for their
computer science class in a week!

Funny enough, my English III class (yes I'm not joking) had an end-of-the-year
project where we could create ***anything*** we wanted. I had trouble
trying to come up with ideas for a project, when I remembered the YouTube
video and got an idea: bring my unfinished project back to life.

You should definitely watch the video, and Poly, if you're reading this, I just want 
to say thank you ***SO MUCH*** for inspiring me!!! I had so much fun making this game
and I hope you have fun playing it! :3

(You should definitely subscribe to Poly, he's so cool for real.)

# How to add songs?

When you download a copy of the game (or the game's source code),
look in the [assets](assets/) folder, add your chart file in the `charts`
folder, your song's background in the `backgrounds` folder, and the 
`.mp3` and `.ogg` sound files in the `songs` folder.

Retro Rhythm will automatically detect the chart and add it to the game,
no coding required!

## Charting

Since I was forced to develop this project in such a short time span, I
did not make a typical built-in editor like most rhythm games, but rather made 
an editor in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) (a heavily modified version of
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)) and made notes by pressing keys
based on what the song sounded like.

You can open the "editor" by downloading the `.sb3` file and then opening it
in TurboWarp (trust me, if you just read the blocks, it won't be very hard
to figure out how it works).

(If you watched the video, you'll immediately notice that I took Poly's idea but 
just made it more advanced lol.)

# Modding

If you really want to mod the game, then read the [compiling info file](COMPILING.md/)
